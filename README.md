Human-mineable crypto currency / decentralized game
========
The main difference is that ~80% of the coins are obtainable by collecting coins in a virtual universe which resides inside the blockchain.

A Simple game is played to collect coins on a map of which has an element of Player vs Player combat to fight over resources. This can be termed as Human (or AI) mining, and the competition which has gotten more difficult over time can be called a Human (or AI) Difficulty level.

Human-mineable proved this concept well and is still in development today.

When a player banks coins inside the world, miners will receive 10% of the players coins, and when a player is killed, miners will receive 4% of dropped coins. This is to encourage miners to process transactions.

Hunters collect coins on the map, then bring them back to spawn areas to transfer them to the users wallet.

What happens when no more coins are generated?
-------
The same as bitcoin, miners will generate income via transacton fees. Although, game transaction fees are a lot more expensive.

Won’t bots take over?
-------
Maybe eventually they will, and it will be humans vs bots, then bots vs bots..
We are currently working on making it more difficult for automated dominator’s.

Why haven’t I heard of Huntercoin?
-------
Huntercoin was created as an experiment and as a hobbiest project. No Marketing or promotion and with a very small team working in our spare time.
